# üîê Chrome Password Extractor

This Python-based tool is an executable file capable of extracting saved passwords stored in the **Google Chrome browser** on a Windows system. It securely retrieves login credentials (usernames and passwords) and exports them into a structured **CSV file** for analysis, backup, or auditing purposes.

## üìÅ Output

  - **Website/ID**
  - **Password**

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Chrome stores saved passwords in a local SQLite database (`Login Data`) and encrypts them using the Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI). This tool:
1. Accesses Chrome's local password storage.
2. Decrypts the encrypted passwords using system credentials.
3. Exports the data into a readable `.csv` file.
